This NSS Capstone Analysis takes a look at hubNashville's 311 Service Requests - Nashville's non-emergency request line for residents and visitors. 

The 311 Requests are analyzed with U.S. Census income and racial demographic data on the zip code level in an effort to determine if Metro Nashville's government services respond to and resolve 311 requests in a fair and balanced manner, regardless of the income level and racial demographic makeup of the location of the request.

Data cleanup, validation, exploratory analysis, and visualizations were done using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. Further visualizations and an interactive dashboard were done in Tableau.
